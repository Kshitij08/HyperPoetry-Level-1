# HyperPoetry-Level-1
“HyperPoetry Level 1” is a WebGL application which was made using Unity for the “Digital Humanities” research cluster at IIT Gandhinagar. It was an initial attempt to bridge the philosophical thought of ‘Continuum Theory’ and the concept of Hypertext through the use of poems that have the subject matter of ‘infinity’ as its core. This project has also been applied for Patent by Srinjoy Ghosh and Kshitij Gajapure (me).
